### 2015 October, 19

After a year of **Jekyll** testing, I'm moving from *Hyde* to *minimal mistakes* theme.

[Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com) kicked ass all others.

## What about colors

**2** restrain or regulate (a fluid, sound, etc.). *to baffle the noise further, I pad the gunwales.*    
noun
